I'm quickly learning that email design is very different from web design, but I'm liking it a lot! <br> <br>
                        Before joining the workforce, I attended Bloomsburg University where I was a major in Art Studio with a minor in marketing. I still enjoy doing art (when I make time). Lately I've been liking working with watercolor a lot. <br><br>I am a mom to a 8 year old chihuahua terrier
                        who I adopted 2 years ago. I love animals and have been a vegetarian for over half my life (13 years)! I also love spending time with my friends and family. I have two sisters who are my best friends.<br><br>
                        I'm excited to continue learning and for my journey after this class.
